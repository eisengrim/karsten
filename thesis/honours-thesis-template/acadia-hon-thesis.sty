%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%% ---------------  Ideas for dealing with widows and clubs -----------------
%
% A widow is a single line at the top of a page.
% A club is a single line at the bottom of a page.
% (Other people use different names.  Moving on...)

% Widows and clubs are typographically displeasing, and so by default
% the TeX typesetting engine has a moderate dislike for widows and
% clubs and will try to break paragraphs (when spitting out a page) to
% avoid them.  However, if you have lots of figures, tables, listings,
% or other such non-textual stuff, or if you like to write short
% paragraphs, you may find that TeX/LaTeX is not able to avoid them.

% Depending on your supervisor and the other readers you may get no
% grief or lots of grief.  This commented out code discusses a couple
% of handraulic techniques for dealing with the problem.  You should
% not waste your time playing with this until you are about to hand a
% ``final draft'' to the reader(s).

% (1) TeX has two parameters that you can adjust to affect how much it
% dislikes widows and clubs.  By default, it gives a ``penalty'' of 150
% to a page any time it would have a widow or club.  That is a minor
% penalty; a penalty of 10000 (the highest meaningful value) means
% (very roughly) ``only do this if there is no better alternatives''.
% You can set the penalties to larger values by uncommenting the
% following two lines and tweaking the numbers:
% \clubpenalty=9999
% \widowpenalty=10000

% (2) While the honours regulations want uniform margins, no one seems
% to squeal if the page is a bit short.  So there are two things you
% can do to affect things everywhere or on a given page (respectively):
% (a) if you uncomment the next line
% \raggedbottom
%     you will invoke some code which may or may not make your life
%     better.  (This is ``plain TeX'' code which may or may not work in
%     LaTeX, if anyone can provide a definitive answer let JD know.)
% (b) anywhere in your document where you want a page break between
%     paragraphs or before a new section, if there is not AT LEAST a 
%     given amount of space left, insert a line like
%            \need 1.4 in
%     to tell LaTeX to start a new page if there isn't at least 1.4 inch
%     left on the current page.  This is better than inserting an
%     unconditional page break, because if you later edit your
%     document and the text moves around, you won't have a page break
%     appearing where you don't want it.
%     For example, if you find a new section shows up too close to the
%     bottom of a page, you can put
%	\need 2 in
%       \section{some new section}
%     to only start that new section on the current page if there is
%     at least 2 inches of space left on the current page.
\def\need{\afterassignment\zneed\dimen@=}
\def\zneed{\relax
    \ifnum\pagetotal>\pagegoal  % Page may be full, but not yet gone
        % See if we can easily (0.3\pageshrink?) shrink the page to fit...
        % If so, bite the bullet & eject the page
        \dimen@=\pagetotal
        \advance\dimen@ by -0.3\pageshrink
        \ifnum\dimen@<\pagegoal

        \fi
    \else
        \vskip 0pt \par
        \ifnum\pagetotal>\pagegoal
            % At great risk, assume an \eject is safe here, since all
            % we've added is glue to get past the end of the page

\comment{
    With luck, you won't need to modify acadia-hon-thesis.sty or header.tex.
    
    In thesis.tex, you should delete the indicated lines immediately
    following ``\begin{document}'' down to the ``END OF START NOTE'' line.
    After that, replace all the lines which \include chapters and appendices
    with the ones which include your chapters and appendices.
    
    In preliminaries.tex, you will want to edit the personalization lines;
    here is an example:
    
    \title{A Practical Investigation of Mustard on Chocolate Cake}
    \author{Bob Smith}
    \dept{Music}
    \deptOrSchool{School}   % or Department
    \degree{Arts}
    
    \submissionMonth{April}
    \submissionYear{2018}
    \copyrightYear{2018}

    % Use a "~" after the "r." of "Dr." so that TeX doesn't think you have
    % ended a sentence (at which point it gives extra space).
    \supervisor{Dr.~Samuel Kazoo}

    % Remove the '%' from the next line and fill in the name if desired.
    %\cosupervisor{(Dr.~Your Other Supervisor)}

    \headOrDirector{Dr.~Johann Liszt}
    % If the head or director is an ``acting'' head or director, uncomment
    % the next line (i.e., delete the '%'):
    % \justActing
    
    % You will have to ask around to find out the name of the person
    % to put here... it changes year to year.
    \honoursCommittee{Dr.~Read And Write}

    The following switches allow for special frontmatter pages; if you
    wish to use them, put them in thesis.tex between ``\include{header}''
    and ``\begin{document}'':
	\algorithmspagetrue   % If you have numbered algorithms in your thesis
	\listingspagetrue     % If you have numbered listings in your thesis
	\figurespagefalse     % If you have no numbered figures in your thesis
	\tablespagefalse      % If you have no numbered tables in your thesis
